## Context

The current system separates product management from document requirements, requiring users to manage these separately. This creates a fragmented experience where users must understand the relationship between products and their required documents across different interfaces. The enhancement aims to provide a unified view and management experience.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals

- Provide integrated product and document requirement management
- Improve user experience with visual indicators and inline editing
- Maintain data integrity between products and document requirements
- Support bulk operations for efficiency

### Non-Goals

- Change the underlying data storage architecture
- Modify document requirement logic beyond product integration
- Add new document types or templates
- Change existing API contracts

## Decisions

### UI Integration Approach

**Decision**: Inline document requirement management within product forms

- **Rationale**: Reduces context switching and provides immediate feedback
- **Trade-off**: Increases form complexity vs separate management
- **Alternative Considered**: Modal dialogs for document requirements

### Data Relationship Model

**Decision**: Maintain separate collections with bidirectional references

- **Rationale**: Preserves existing data integrity and allows independent querying
- **Trade-off**: Requires synchronization logic vs embedded relationships
- **Alternative Considered**: Embed document requirements in product documents

### Visual Indicators

**Decision**: Color-coded status indicators and requirement counts

- **Rationale**: Provides quick visual feedback without detailed reading
- **Trade-off**: Adds UI complexity vs text-only indicators
- **Alternative Considered**: Icon-only indicators

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Data Synchronization

- **Risk**: Inconsistent state between products and document requirements
- **Mitigation**: Implement validation and cascade updates
- **Impact**: Potential data integrity issues if not handled properly

### UI Complexity

- **Risk**: Overwhelming interface with too much information
- **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure and collapsible sections
- **Impact**: Poor user experience if not balanced

### Performance

- **Risk**: Loading document requirements with products increases query complexity
- **Mitigation**: Implement efficient data loading and caching
- **Impact**: Slower page loads if not optimized

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Data Model Updates

1. Update Product interface to include document requirement references
2. Modify data loading hooks to include related document requirements
3. Add validation logic for product-document relationships

### Phase 2: UI Enhancements

1. Add document requirement sections to product list and detail views
2. Implement inline editing capabilities
3. Add visual indicators and status displays

### Phase 3: Integration and Validation

1. Implement cascade updates and relationship validation
2. Add bulk operations for efficiency
3. Comprehensive testing of integrated workflows

## Open Questions

1. **Bulk Operations**: Should we support editing document requirements for multiple products simultaneously?
2. **Validation Timing**: When should product-document validation occur (on save, real-time, etc.)?
3. **Performance Thresholds**: What's the acceptable load time for product lists with document requirements?
4. **Offline Support**: How should this work in offline scenarios?
