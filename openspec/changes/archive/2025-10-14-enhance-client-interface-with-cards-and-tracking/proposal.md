## Why

The current client interface uses a table-based layout that is not intuitive or visually engaging. Users need a more modern card-based interface that provides quick access to client details and comprehensive tracking of client interactions including invoices, payments, emails, and documents.

## What Changes

- Replace table-based client list with responsive card layout showing key client information
- Make client cards clickable to navigate to detailed client view
- Enhance client detail page with improved tabbed interface for better organization
- Add dedicated invoice detail page with comprehensive payment history
- Add email tracking tab to show all communications sent to client
- Add document tracking tab to show all documents sent to client
- Improve navigation and user experience with better visual hierarchy

## Impact

- Affected specs: client-dashboard, invoice-payment-management, email-service, document-delivery
- Affected code: src/routes/(app)/clients/+page.svelte, src/routes/(app)/clients/[id]/+page.svelte, new invoice detail route
- User experience: More intuitive navigation and better client relationship management
- Development effort: Medium complexity involving UI redesign and new routing
