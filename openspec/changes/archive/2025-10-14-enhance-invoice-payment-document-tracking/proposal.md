## Why

Users need a simple way to manage clients, track their product purchases, create orders, and send documents (both custom PDFs and template-based) with flexible email options. The current system has separate components but lacks an integrated client-centric workflow.

## What Changes

- **Client Product Management**: Show all products purchased by each client with order creation capability
- **Simple Document Sending**: Easy interface to send custom PDFs or template documents to clients
- **Flexible Email Composition**: Ability to modify email messages when sending documents
- **Basic Payment Tracking**: Simple invoice payment status tracking per client
- **Document Selection**: Intuitive interface to select which documents to include in emails

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: invoice-payment-management, document-delivery, document-generation, document-requirements
- **Affected code**: Client management, invoice pages, document delivery interface
- **User experience**: Streamlined client-focused workflow for orders and document delivery
