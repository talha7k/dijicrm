# State Management Specification

## Purpose

Define the requirements for simplifying and unifying the state management architecture to support the centralized authentication flow and eliminate race conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Simplified App State Structure

The system SHALL simplify the app store to use a clean status-based architecture instead of multiple boolean flags.

#### Scenario: App state initialization

- **WHEN** the application loads
- **THEN** the app store SHALL initialize with status 'loading'
- **AND** clear any previous error states
- **AND** provide loading message for UI components

#### Scenario: App state transitions

- **WHEN** authentication state changes
- **THEN** the app store SHALL transition to appropriate status
- **AND** support 'loading', 'ready', 'error', 'unauthenticated' states
- **AND** ensure states are mutually exclusive
- **AND** provide clear status messages

#### Scenario: Error state management

- **WHEN** errors occur in the authentication flow
- **THEN** the app store SHALL set status to 'error'
- **AND** store error message for display
- **AND** provide error recovery options

### Requirement: User Store Simplification

The system SHALL simplify the user store to focus only on user data management, removing authentication logic.

#### Scenario: User data synchronization

- **WHEN** authentication state changes
- **THEN** the user store SHALL receive user data from auth service
- **AND** update profile data without authentication logic
- **AND** maintain loading states for data operations only

#### Scenario: User profile updates

- **WHEN** user profile is updated
- **THEN** the user store SHALL update the profile data
- **AND** persist changes to Firestore
- **AND** notify auth service of profile changes

#### Scenario: User store cleanup

- **WHEN** user signs out
- **THEN** the user store SHALL clear all user data
- **AND** reset to initial state
- **AND** clean up any active listeners

### Requirement: Company Context Store Simplification

The system SHALL simplify the company context store to focus only on company data management, removing app state coordination.

#### Scenario: Company data loading

- **WHEN** user is authenticated with valid company
- **THEN** the company store SHALL load company data
- **AND** set up real-time listeners for company updates
- **AND** handle company data loading states

#### Scenario: Company switching

- **WHEN** user switches companies
- **THEN** the company store SHALL update company context
- **AND** clean up previous company listeners
- **AND** initialize new company data

#### Scenario: Company store cleanup

- **WHEN** user signs out or switches to invalid company
- **THEN** the company store SHALL clear company data
- **AND** clean up all listeners
- **AND** reset to initial state

### Requirement: Store Coordination Removal

The system SHALL remove direct store-to-store coordination, centralizing all coordination through the auth service.

#### Scenario: Auth service coordination

- **WHEN** authentication state changes
- **THEN** the auth service SHALL coordinate all store updates
- **AND** update user store with profile data
- **AND** update company store with company data
- **AND** update app store with status

#### Scenario: Elimination of cross-store dependencies

- **WHEN** stores need to communicate
- **THEN** communication SHALL go through auth service
- **AND** stores SHALL NOT directly update other stores
- **AND** auth service SHALL be the single coordinator

### Requirement: Derived State Optimization

The system SHALL optimize derived states to prevent unnecessary computations and re-renders.

#### Scenario: Loading state derivation

- **WHEN** components need loading state
- **THEN** derived loading states SHALL be efficiently computed
- **AND** prevent redundant calculations
- **AND** update only when underlying states change

#### Scenario: Authentication state derivation

- **WHEN** components need authentication status
- **THEN** derived auth states SHALL be computed from app store
- **AND** provide clear boolean flags for UI logic
- **AND** be memoized for performance

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Store Migration Strategy

The system SHALL provide a clean migration path from the current complex state to the simplified architecture.

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility

- **WHEN** migrating to new state structure
- **THEN** the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility during transition
- **AND** provide adapter functions for existing code
- **AND** allow gradual migration of components

#### Scenario: Data validation

- **WHEN** migrating store data
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate data integrity
- **AND** handle missing or corrupted data gracefully
- **AND** provide fallback values for missing fields

### Requirement: Performance Optimization

The system SHALL optimize store performance for better user experience.

#### Scenario: Lazy loading

- **WHEN** loading large datasets
- **THEN** stores SHALL implement lazy loading patterns
- **AND** load data only when needed
- **AND** provide loading indicators during data fetch

#### Scenario: Memory management

- **WHEN** managing store subscriptions
- **THEN** stores SHALL properly clean up subscriptions
- **AND** prevent memory leaks
- **AND** optimize subscription patterns

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: App Store Structure

The system SHALL modify the app store to use a simplified status-based approach.

#### Scenario: Status enum implementation

- **WHEN** representing app state
- **THEN** the app store SHALL use status enum instead of boolean flags
- **AND** eliminate impossible state combinations
- **AND** provide clear state transitions

#### Scenario: Message handling

- **WHEN** providing user feedback
- **THEN** the app store SHALL include status messages
- **AND** provide context for current operations
- **AND** support internationalization

### Requirement: Store Initialization

The system SHALL modify store initialization to be coordinated by the auth service.

#### Scenario: Coordinated initialization

- **WHEN** application starts
- **THEN** auth service SHALL coordinate store initialization
- **AND** initialize stores in correct order
- **AND** handle initialization failures gracefully

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Complex App State Flags

_Removed: Multiple boolean flags (initializing, authenticated, profileReady, companyReady) will be replaced with a single status enum._

### Requirement: Store-to-Store Communication

_Removed: Direct store-to-store updates will be eliminated in favor of auth service coordination._

### Requirement: Redundant Loading States

_Removed: Multiple loading states across stores will be consolidated into a single source of truth._

### Requirement: Client-side Auth State Management

_Removed: Client-side auth state validation will be replaced with server-first approach._
