### Requirement: Auth Page Integration

The system SHALL update auth pages to integrate with the unified auth service.

#### Scenario: Sign-in page auth state

- **WHEN** user visits sign-in page

#### Scenario: Sign-up page flow

- **WHEN** user visits sign-up page
- **THEN** the page SHALL check auth service state
- **AND** redirect to dashboard if already authenticated
- **AND** handle invitation tokens from URL
- **AND** integrate with auth service for registration

#### Scenario: Auth page navigation

- **WHEN** user navigates between auth pages
- **THEN** pages SHALL maintain consistent auth state
- **AND** preserve form data when appropriate
- **AND** handle browser back/forward properly
- **AND** integrate with auth service state

### Requirement: Component Loading State Standardization

The system SHALL standardize loading states across all auth components.

#### Scenario: Consistent loading indicators

- **WHEN** auth operations are in progress
- **THEN** all components SHALL use consistent loading UI
- **AND** use the standardized Loading component
- **AND** provide appropriate loading messages
- **AND** maintain accessibility standards

#### Scenario: Loading state propagation

- **WHEN** auth service loading state changes
- **THEN** components SHALL reflect loading state immediately
- **AND** provide visual feedback for all operations
- **AND** handle loading state transitions smoothly
- **AND** prevent user interaction during loading

### Requirement: Error Handling Standardization

The system SHALL standardize error handling across all auth components.

#### Scenario: Consistent error display

- **WHEN** auth errors occur
- **THEN** components SHALL display errors consistently
- **AND** use toast notifications for error messages
- **AND** provide clear error descriptions
- **AND** offer recovery options when appropriate

#### Scenario: Error recovery

- **WHEN** auth operations fail
- **THEN** components SHALL allow retry attempts
- **AND** provide clear retry instructions
- **AND** maintain form data for retry
- **AND** handle different error types appropriately

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Accessibility Compliance

The system SHALL ensure all auth components meet accessibility standards.

#### Scenario: Screen reader support

- **AND** follow consistent patterns

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Session Cookie Creation

_Removed: Session cookie creation will be handled centrally by auth service, not individual components._

### Requirement: Direct Firebase Auth Calls

_Removed: Components will not directly call Firebase Auth methods, going through auth service instead._

### Requirement: Component-Level Navigation

_Removed: Navigation after auth operations will be handled by auth service, not individual components._

### Requirement: Component-Level Error Handling

_Removed: Auth error handling will be centralized in auth service, components will only display errors._
