## Why

The current product/service management system has document requirements as separate entities that reference products, creating a loose coupling that makes it difficult for users to understand and manage the complete product offering. When creating or editing products, users need to separately manage document requirements, leading to potential mismatches and a fragmented user experience.

## What Changes

- **Enhanced Product Management**: Products will display their associated document requirements directly in the product interface
- **Integrated Document Requirement Management**: Add/edit document requirements directly from the product management interface
- **Visual Document Requirement Indicators**: Clear visual indicators showing which documents are required for each product
- **Product-Document Validation**: Ensure document requirements are properly maintained when products are modified
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Single interface for managing complete product offerings including all required documentation

## Impact

- Affected specs: product-management (enhanced with document integration)
- Affected code: Product management pages, document requirement components, product data models
- No breaking changes to existing APIs, but enhanced UI/UX for product management
