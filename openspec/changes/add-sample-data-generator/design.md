## Architecture Overview

### Server-Side Sample Data Generation

The sample data generator will be implemented as a SvelteKit API route (`/api/sample-data/+server.ts`) that runs server-side using the Firebase Admin SDK. This ensures:

1. **Security**: Sensitive operations like bulk data creation happen server-side
2. **Performance**: No client-side processing of large datasets
3. **Reliability**: Server-side execution avoids client-side limitations (timeouts, network issues)

### Data Structure

The generator will create interconnected sample data following the application's domain model:

- **Company**: Base company with branding settings
- **Clients**: Multiple client accounts with realistic contact information
- **Products/Services**: Catalog of billable items
- **Document Templates**: Pre-built templates for invoices and contracts
- **Invoices**: Complete invoice records with line items and payment history
- **Payments**: Associated payment records

### Firebase Admin SDK Usage

The implementation will use Firebase Admin SDK for:

- **Firestore**: Creating documents in collections (companies, clients, invoices, etc.)
- **Authentication**: Creating user accounts for sample clients
- **Storage**: Uploading sample files (logos, documents) if needed

### Client-Side Integration

The settings page will include:

- **Generate Sample Data Button**: Triggers the API call
- **Progress Feedback**: Shows loading state during generation
- **Success/Error Handling**: Displays results and handles failures
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Warns about overwriting existing data

### Mock Data Removal Strategy

Components currently using mock data will be updated to:

1. Show loading states while data is being fetched
2. Display empty states with helpful messages when no data exists
3. Provide clear calls-to-action (e.g., "Create your first invoice")

### Error Handling & Rollback

The generator will implement transaction-like behavior:

- **Atomic Operations**: Use Firestore batch writes where possible
- **Partial Failure Handling**: Log errors but continue with other data
- **Cleanup**: Provide mechanism to remove generated sample data if needed

### Performance Considerations

- **Batch Operations**: Use Firestore batch writes to minimize round trips
- **Chunking**: Process data in chunks to avoid memory issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Provide real-time progress updates to the client

### Security & Access Control

- **Admin Only**: Only company administrators can generate sample data
- **Environment Checks**: Prevent accidental data generation in production
- **Audit Logging**: Log sample data generation events
