## Why

The current system only provides basic invoice data without proper document generation and management. Businesses need to send various legal and business documents (power of attorney, intent forms, etc.) along with invoices. Clients need a way to receive, review, fill out, and submit these documents digitally or via file upload. This creates a complete document workflow from generation to completion.

## What Changes

- **Product/Service Management**: Centralized management of products and services offered by the company
- **Document Templates**: HTML-based templates with placeholder values for invoices and other business documents
- **Document Requirements**: Associate specific documents with products/services that require them
- **Document Generation**: Generate documents from templates with actual data when cases are created
- **Document Delivery**: Email delivery of generated documents to clients
- **Client Document Management**: Client dashboard for viewing, filling, and submitting documents with file upload capability
- **Invoice Integration**: Enhanced invoice creation with product/service line items and automatic document requirements

## Impact

- Affected code: New product/service management, document management system, email integration, file upload functionality, enhanced client dashboard, invoice creation with line items
