## Context

This document management system addresses the need for businesses to send various legal and business documents along with invoices. The current system only handles basic invoice data without proper document generation, delivery, or client interaction workflows.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals

- Enable HTML template-based document generation with placeholders
- Support complex document requirements based on products/services
- Provide seamless client experience for document review and submission
- Ensure secure file handling and access controls
- Maintain audit trails and version history

### Non-Goals

- Advanced document editing capabilities (focus on templates and forms)
- Integration with third-party document services
- Real-time collaborative document editing
- Advanced PDF manipulation beyond HTML-to-PDF conversion

## Decisions

### Architecture Pattern

**Decision**: Separate capabilities with shared data layer

- **Rationale**: Complex system with distinct concerns (templates, requirements, generation, delivery, client management)
- **Trade-off**: Some data duplication vs clear separation of concerns
- **Alternative Considered**: Monolithic document service

### Template System

**Decision**: HTML-based templates with handlebars-style placeholders

- **Rationale**: Familiar to developers, flexible for complex layouts, easy to preview
- **Trade-off**: Limited to HTML/CSS vs more advanced document formats
- **Alternative Considered**: Rich text editors or document builders

### Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Firebase Storage for files, Firestore for metadata

- **Rationale**: Consistent with existing Firebase architecture, good performance
- **Trade-off**: Vendor lock-in vs multi-cloud flexibility
- **Alternative Considered**: AWS S3 or self-hosted storage

### Client Interaction Model

**Decision**: Hybrid approach - digital forms + file upload

- **Rationale**: Supports both digital-native and traditional workflows
- **Trade-off**: Complexity of dual interfaces vs single approach
- **Alternative Considered**: Digital-only or upload-only

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Security Risks

- **File upload vulnerabilities**: Mitigated by strict validation, size limits, and virus scanning
- **Data privacy**: Client documents contain sensitive information, requires careful access controls
- **Email delivery risks**: Potential for email spoofing, mitigated by proper authentication

### Performance Considerations

- **PDF generation load**: HTML-to-PDF conversion can be resource-intensive
- **File storage costs**: Large document volumes could increase Firebase costs
- **Email delivery scaling**: Bulk email sending needs rate limiting

### Complexity Management

- **Multiple integration points**: Email, file storage, PDF generation
- **Client-side complexity**: Supporting both digital and upload workflows
- **Template maintenance**: Ensuring templates remain valid as business needs change

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Implement template system and basic generation
2. Set up file storage and upload capabilities
3. Create document metadata structures

### Phase 2: Business Logic

1. Build document requirements system
2. Implement case-based document generation
3. Add email delivery functionality

### Phase 3: Client Experience

1. Develop client document dashboard
2. Implement digital form filling
3. Add file upload and submission workflows

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing

1. Integrate with existing invoice system
2. Comprehensive testing and validation
3. Performance optimization and monitoring

## Open Questions

1. **PDF Generation Library**: Which HTML-to-PDF library to use? (Puppeteer, Playwright, or cloud service)
2. **Email Service**: SendGrid vs Mailgun vs Firebase Extensions?
3. **File Size Limits**: What are reasonable limits for document uploads?
4. **Offline Support**: Do we need offline document access for clients?
5. **Audit Requirements**: What level of audit logging is required for legal compliance?
