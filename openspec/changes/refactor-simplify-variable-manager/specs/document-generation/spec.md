## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Template Data Rendering

The system SHALL render document templates using Handlebars with simple data objects passed directly to the template rendering function, without complex variable management or tracking.

#### Scenario: Handlebars template rendering

- **WHEN** a template is rendered with data object
- **THEN** the system uses Handlebars to process {{key}} placeholders, {{#if}} conditions, {{#each}} loops, and helpers
- **AND** no complex variable management is involved

#### Scenario: System data auto-loading

- **WHEN** generating a document for a client
- **THEN** the system automatically loads company data, client data, and order data from collections
- **AND** merges this data into a single data object for Handlebars template rendering

### Requirement: Essential System Variables Only

The system SHALL provide only essential system variables that are automatically generated, removing complex variable catalogs and management.

#### Scenario: Minimal system variables

- **WHEN** rendering a template
- **THEN** only essential variables like currentDate, companyName, clientName are available
- **AND** these are automatically populated from database collections

#### Scenario: No variable tracking

- **WHEN** templates use variables
- **THEN** the system does not track usage, count, or manage variable templates
- **AND** variables are simple key-value replacements

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Complex Variable Management

**Reason**: Over-engineered complexity that provides little value and creates maintenance overhead.

**Migration**: Replace with simple data object approach where template data is passed directly to rendering functions.

### Requirement: Variable Templates and Collections

**Reason**: Unnecessary abstraction layer that complicates the system without clear benefits.

**Migration**: Remove template concept and use direct data objects for template rendering.

### Requirement: Variable Detection and Analysis

**Reason**: Complex feature that attempts to auto-detect variables but adds unnecessary complexity.

**Migration**: Remove detection features and rely on explicit data object structure for template rendering.
